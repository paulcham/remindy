# Icon Setup

The extension requires icon files. You have two options:

## Option 1: Use the Icon Generator

1. Open `create-icons.html` in your browser
2. Click the "Download" buttons for each icon size
3. Save the files as `icon16.png`, `icon48.png`, and `icon128.png` in the extension root directory

## Option 2: Create Your Own Icons

Create three PNG files:
- `icon16.png` (16x16 pixels)
- `icon48.png` (48x48 pixels)  
- `icon128.png` (128x128 pixels)

Place them in the extension root directory.

## Option 3: Use Placeholder Icons

The extension will work without icons, but Chrome will show a default extension icon. You can add icons later.
